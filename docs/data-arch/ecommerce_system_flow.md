# Ecommerce CDC System Flow

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the business flow for a computer-hardware ecommerce system that will be used as the source domain for a real-time CDC pipeline.

The goal is to avoid random mock inserts and instead generate realistic operational changes through business actions such as customer registration, cart updates, order placement, payment, shipment, stock movement, supplier restocking, and returns.

Target data path:

```text
Source Application
-> PostgreSQL operational database
-> Debezium CDC
-> Kafka topics
-> Flink stream processing
-> Iceberg tables
-> MinIO / S3 lakehouse storage
```



## 2. Domain Overview

The system represents an ecommerce platform that sells computer hardware such as CPUs, GPUs, RAM, SSDs, monitors, peripherals, power supplies, cases, and cooling products.

The operational system must support:

- Customer account management.
- Multiple customer addresses.
- Product catalog management.
- Product categorization.
- Brand and supplier tracking.
- Warehouse-level inventory.
- Inventory movements.
- Shopping carts.
- Order placement.
- Payment processing.
- Shipment tracking.
- Returns and refunds.
- Promotions and discount campaigns.
- Supplier purchase orders for restocking.

## 6. End-to-End System Flow



### 6.1 Source Application Flow

The source application is responsible for creating valid business changes in PostgreSQL. It should not insert random rows independently into unrelated tables.

Recommended service:

```text
FastAPI service
-> SQLAlchemy models
-> PostgreSQL transactions
```

Each API or background worker action should represent a real business event.

Examples:

- Register customer.
- Add customer address.
- Add product to cart.
- Convert cart to order.
- Process payment.
- Create shipment.
- Update shipment status.
- Request return.
- Receive returned item.
- Restock product from supplier.
- Update product price.



### 6.2 Operational Database Flow

PostgreSQL is the source of truth for the operational system.

The database stores:

- Current state records, such as customer, product, order, payment, shipment, and inventory.
- Append-style activity records, such as inventory movements, order items, return items, and purchase order items.

PostgreSQL must run with logical replication enabled so Debezium can read changes from the write-ahead log.

### 6.3 CDC Flow

Debezium reads PostgreSQL changes from the WAL and publishes them to Kafka.

Recommended topic pattern:

```text
cdc.ecommerce.<table_name>
```

Examples:

```text
cdc.ecommerce.customers
cdc.ecommerce.products
cdc.ecommerce.inventory
cdc.ecommerce.orders
cdc.ecommerce.order_items
cdc.ecommerce.payments
cdc.ecommerce.shipments
cdc.ecommerce.returns
```

Each CDC event contains:

- `before`: previous row state.
- `after`: new row state.
- `op`: operation type.
- `source`: source database metadata.
- `ts_ms`: event timestamp.

Debezium operation types:


| Operation | Meaning         |
| --------- | --------------- |
| `c`       | Create / insert |
| `u`       | Update          |
| `d`       | Delete          |
| `r`       | Snapshot read   |




### 6.4 Kafka Flow

Kafka acts as the durable streaming layer between the operational database and downstream consumers.

Kafka responsibilities:

- Store table-level CDC events.
- Preserve event ordering within partitions.
- Allow multiple consumers, such as dashboards, validation tools, and Flink jobs.
- Decouple the operational database from lakehouse processing.

Recommended partition key:

```text
Primary key of the source table
```

Examples:

- `customer_id` for `customers`.
- `order_id` for `orders`.
- `product_id` for `products`.
- `inventory_id` or `(product_id, warehouse_id)` for `inventory`.



### 6.5 Stream Processing Flow

Flink consumes CDC events from Kafka and transforms them for the lakehouse.

Flink responsibilities:

- Parse Debezium envelopes.
- Extract the business row from `after`.
- Handle deletes from `before`.
- Add CDC metadata.
- Apply upserts and deletes to Iceberg tables.
- Maintain checkpoints for restart safety.

Each output table should include business columns plus CDC metadata:

```text
cdc_op
cdc_source_ts_ms
cdc_processed_at
cdc_topic
cdc_partition
cdc_offset
```



### 6.6 Lakehouse Flow

Iceberg tables on MinIO or S3 represent the analytical version of the operational system.

Recommended layers:

```text
bronze: raw Debezium CDC events
silver: cleaned current-state tables
gold: business analytics marts
```

Bronze examples:

```text
bronze.cdc_customers_raw
bronze.cdc_orders_raw
bronze.cdc_inventory_raw
```

Silver examples:

```text
silver.customers
silver.products
silver.inventory
silver.orders
silver.order_items
silver.payments
```

Gold examples:

```text
gold.daily_revenue
gold.product_sales_performance
gold.inventory_risk
gold.customer_lifetime_value
gold.return_rate_by_product
```



## 7. Key Business Flows



### 7.1 Customer Registration Flow

```text
1. Customer registers.
2. Row is inserted into customers.
3. One or more rows are inserted into customer_addresses.
4. Debezium captures the inserts.
5. Kafka receives customer and address events.
6. Flink updates Iceberg customer/address tables.
```

Tables changed:

- `customers`
- `customer_addresses`

CDC topics:

- `cdc.ecommerce.customers`

- `cdc.ecommerce.cart_items`



### 7.4 Order Placement Flow

```text
1. Customer checks out cart.
2. Application validates customer, addresses, products, and inventory.
3. Order header is inserted into orders.
4. Cart items are converted into order_items.
5. Inventory is reserved or decreased.
6. Inventory movement records are created.
7. Cart status changes to checked_out.
8. Debezium captures all changes in the transaction.
```

Tables changed:

- `orders`
- `order_items`
- `inventory`
- `inventory_movements`
- `carts`
- `cart_items`

CDC topics:

- `cdc.ecommerce.orders`
- `cdc.ecommerce.order_items`
- `cdc.ecommerce.inventory`
- `cdc.ecommerce.inventory_movements`
- `cdc.ecommerce.carts`
- `cdc.ecommerce.cart_items`

Important rule:

```text
Order placement should be one database transaction.
```

This keeps the operational database consistent when inventory and order records change together.

### 7.5 Payment Flow

```text
1. Payment attempt is created.
2. Payment provider response is simulated.
3. Payment is marked succeeded, failed, cancelled, or refunded.

7. Payment may be refunded or partially refunded.
```

Tables changed:

- `returns`
- `return_items`
- `inventory`
- `inventory_movements`
- `payments`
- `orders`

CDC topics:

- `cdc.ecommerce.returns`
- `cdc.ecommerce.return_items`

2. Product row is updated.
3. Future cart and order items use the new price.
4. Existing order_items keep their historical unit_price.
```

Tables changed:

- `products`
- Optional future table: `product_prices`

CDC topics:

- `cdc.ecommerce.products`

Important rule:

```text
Never calculate historical revenue from current product price.
Use order_items.unit_price.
```

## 8. Table Classification for CDC

### 8.1 Current-State Tables

These tables represent the latest state of business entities and should usually be written to Iceberg with upsert/delete semantics.

```text
customers
customer_addresses
brands
categories
products
suppliers
warehouses
inventory
carts
orders
payments
shipments
returns
promotions
```

### 8.2 Relationship Tables

These tables represent many-to-many relationships or child records.

```text
product_categories
supplier_products
cart_items
order_items
purchase_order_items
return_items
```

### 8.3 Event-Like Tables

These tables behave like business history and are useful as append-style analytical facts.

```text
inventory_movements
payments
shipments
return_items
purchase_order_items
```

## 11. Recommended Event Scenarios for Mock Data Generation

The mock generator should call source application actions or service functions instead of directly inserting unrelated random rows.

Recommended scenarios:

```text
register_customer
create_address
create_cart
add_item_to_cart
update_cart_quantity
checkout_cart
payment_succeeds
payment_fails
create_shipment
advance_shipment_status
create_purchase_order
receive_purchase_order
request_return
approve_return
receive_return
refund_payment
update_product_price
restock_inventory
adjust_inventory
```

Each scenario should produce coordinated writes across multiple tables.

Example:

```text
checkout_cart
-> insert orders
-> insert order_items
-> update inventory
-> insert inventory_movements
-> update carts
```

## 12. Data Consistency Rules

Recommended rules:

- `orders.total_amount` must equal subtotal minus discounts plus shipping and tax.
- `order_items.unit_price` must snapshot the price at purchase time.
- `inventory.quantity_on_hand` must not go below zero.
- `inventory.quantity_reserved` must not exceed `quantity_on_hand`.
- `payments.amount` should not exceed the order total unless multiple payment behavior is explicitly supported.
- `shipments` should only be created for paid or approved orders.
- `returns` should only be created for shipped or delivered orders.
- `return_items.quantity_returned` must not exceed original `order_items.quantity`.
- `inventory_movements.quantity_after` should reflect the inventory state after the movement.
- `purchase_order_items.quantity_received` must not exceed `quantity_ordered`.

## 13. CDC Design Notes

Recommended Debezium choices:

- Use one topic per table.
- Use table primary key as Kafka message key.
- Enable transaction metadata if cross-table transaction analysis is needed.
- Use full replica identity for tables where complete `before` values are required.
- Treat deletes carefully because Debezium may emit delete and tombstone records.

Recommended Kafka topic naming:

```text
cdc.ecommerce.customers
cdc.ecommerce.customer_addresses
cdc.ecommerce.brands
cdc.ecommerce.categories
cdc.ecommerce.products
cdc.ecommerce.product_categories
cdc.ecommerce.suppliers
cdc.ecommerce.supplier_products
cdc.ecommerce.warehouses
cdc.ecommerce.inventory
cdc.ecommerce.inventory_movements
cdc.ecommerce.purchase_orders
cdc.ecommerce.purchase_order_items
cdc.ecommerce.carts
cdc.ecommerce.cart_items
cdc.ecommerce.orders
cdc.ecommerce.order_items
cdc.ecommerce.payments
cdc.ecommerce.shipments
cdc.ecommerce.returns
cdc.ecommerce.return_items
cdc.ecommerce.promotions
```

## 14. Lakehouse Mapping

Recommended Iceberg table mapping:


| Source table          | Bronze table                         | Silver table                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `customers`           | `bronze.cdc_customers_raw`           | `silver.customers`           |
| `customer_addresses`  | `bronze.cdc_customer_addresses_raw`  | `silver.customer_addresses`  |
| `products`            | `bronze.cdc_products_raw`            | `silver.products`            |
| `inventory`           | `bronze.cdc_inventory_raw`           | `silver.inventory`           |
| `inventory_movements` | `bronze.cdc_inventory_movements_raw` | `silver.inventory_movements` |
| `orders`              | `bronze.cdc_orders_raw`              | `silver.orders`              |
| `order_items`         | `bronze.cdc_order_items_raw`         | `silver.order_items`         |
| `payments`            | `bronze.cdc_payments_raw`            | `silver.payments`            |
| `shipments`           | `bronze.cdc_shipments_raw`           | `silver.shipments`           |
| `returns`             | `bronze.cdc_returns_raw`             | `silver.returns`             |
| `return_items`        | `bronze.cdc_return_items_raw`        | `silver.return_items`        |


Suggested gold marts:

```text
gold.daily_sales
gold.product_revenue
gold.customer_lifetime_value
gold.inventory_stockout_risk
gold.payment_failure_rate
gold.return_rate_by_product
gold.supplier_lead_time_performance
```

## 15. First Build Target

The first build should prove one complete vertical slice:

```text
Customer registers
-> Customer creates cart
-> Customer adds product
-> Customer checks out
-> Order and order items are created
-> Inventory decreases
-> Payment succeeds
-> Shipment is created
-> Debezium captures changes
-> Kafka receives topic events
```

Minimum tables for first vertical slice:

```text
customers
customer_addresses
brands
categories
products
product_categories
warehouses
inventory
carts
cart_items
orders
order_items
payments
shipments
inventory_movements
```

Success criteria:

- A single business action updates multiple related tables correctly.
- Debezium captures all changed tables.
- Kafka topics receive events with valid keys and payloads.
- The Streamlit or validation consumer can display the business flow.
- The design can later be extended to Flink and Iceberg without changing the source domain.
